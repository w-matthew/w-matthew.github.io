Welcome to my website! I'm a graduate student at USC studying Electrical Engineering, specializing in analog and digital IC design. My experience includes working as a Design Verification Intern at Celestial AI, and undergraduate researcher in the Chien Lab @ [BSAC](https://bsac.berkeley.edu/).

In 2026, I'm looking to build from my analog IC coursework by gaining experience through an internship in AMS design.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing in intermural leagues for basketball, using my Dobsonian telescope to look at the night sky, and playing chess.
