Welcome to my website! I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, specializing in analog and digital IC design. My experience includes working as an undergraduate research assistant in the Chien Lab @ [BSAC](https://bsac.berkeley.edu/) and as a data engineering intern at [Citylitics](https://citylitics.com/) this past summer.

Currently, my personal projects involve designing an analog IC driver for an Apple Watch and developing a multi-protocol communication FPGA. In the Chien Lab, I am working on designing a PCB and programming a pipetting robot to help automate 3-electrode system experiments.

When I'm not trying to meet timing constraints or debugging code, you'll find me reading a fantasy [novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45857086-the-burning-god), playing a board game, or exploring hypothetical mods for my ThinkPad (both OS and hardware).
